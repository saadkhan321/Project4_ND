Corrections from the 1st submission:

- Code character per line limited to 80 characters with the help of show margin feature in RStudio. Indentation/formatting done to accomadate each layer of ggplot on a seperate line where it was poosible.

- A combination of hex color coding on the url: http://colorbrewer2.org/ and colors used in Plot 3 was used to better represent quality ratings on scatter plots in the multi-variate section.

- Axes limitation/scaling and jitter were used on plots where required in order to better represent and analyze the data.

- Url: http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/skewness.html was used to understand the skewness in distributions and the concept was applied to the interpretation of skewed plots in the report.

- Although, I met the specifications for the plots summary section, I modified Plot 2 to include box plots for alcohol vs. qualiy of white wine samples.

-  Struggles sub-section was added to Reflection section to mention some of the problems/difficulies experienced during the report writing and coding in R.
